A project about redoing the mobile Firefox
## Warning 
This is a hobby project and  don't know how often it will be updated, it's experimental (and also probably badly written)

Currently nothing to install 
## FAQ
* **Is Projectfox the final name of the project?**

No I'm just bad at naming stuff so I went with something I came up on the spot, I'll definitely have to change that later
